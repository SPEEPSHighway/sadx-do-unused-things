This quick mod does a few things to show unused stuff:

Barricade HP,
SS Cars hitting player (I also edited the speed requirement to make it easier to trigger),
Traffic light colours
Twinkle Circuit act select (Press A+DRight),
Card animation (Did on the Kart pass since it has both anims)
Use Test Spawn/Meme Maker 2's flag menu for quick access to stuff.

Feel free to use this code in your own mods.
